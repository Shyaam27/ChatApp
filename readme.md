## **Project Overview**
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project to research, plan and develop a Full-stack project - a chat app in 10 days.

### **This Website Features**
- Login functionality
- Registration
- Add/remove friends
- Chat with friends
- Switch chats

## **Setup and Instructions for using the Project**

1. This Full-stack project runs on React and Express. Make sure you have Node and MongoDB installed to run the API and React. We used VSCode and MongoDB Compass for this project.
2. Clone [Chat App](https://github.com/YoyoMai98/chat-app-full-stack.git) by typing the following commands into your terminal:
```git clone git@github.com:YoyoMai98/chat-app-full-stack.git```. Open in VSCode.
3. Within VSCode, navigate your terminal to the `express.js_server` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
4. Navigate your terminal to the `react.js_app` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
5. Navigate to your web browser and if it has not already displayed, enter in the following URL:
```http://localhost:3000/```
